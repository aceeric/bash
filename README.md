# bash
Useful Bash shell scripts. I don't do a ton of Bash shell scripting, but this project has a few scripts that I have written that I find generally useful. I run these on Ubuntu 18.04.

| Shell script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| apt-hist | Displays a condensed history of apt commands sorted in descending order |
| args-and-usage | Demonstrates parsing command-line args and displaying usage instructions |
| dirsize | Prints directories and their sizes in descending order |
| do-backup | Performs a backup of selected directories to a removable drive |
| gl | Git Log. Displays git commit history nicely formatted - single line per commit - fitted to the console |
| hist | Displays command history filtered on search terms with matches highlighted |
| sysinfos | Invokes various linux utils to gather system info and just formats the outputs differently. Mostly an exercise in parsing & formatting |
| tre | Displays a directory tree using bash. Just as an interesting shell programming exercise |
| wpslide | Wallpaper slide-show. On each run, displays the next wallpaper from a directory in round-robin style |
