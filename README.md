# bash
Useful Bash shell scripts. I run these on Ubuntu 18.04, Bash 4.4

| Shell script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| apt-hist | Displays a condensed history of apt commands sorted in descending order |
| args-and-usage | Demonstrates parsing command-line args and displaying usage instructions |
| clone-vbox | Clones and starts a Virtualbox VM from an existing VM image |
| dirsize | Prints directories and their sizes in descending order |
| do-backup | Performs a backup of selected directories to a removable drive |
| elapsed | Calculates and displays the elapsed time between two values. Useful for benchmarking |
| fragments (directory) | This directory contains isolated useful scripting techniques |
| gl | Git Log. Displays git commit history nicely formatted - single line per commit - fitted to the console |
| hist | Displays command history filtered on search terms with matches highlighted. E.g. `hist foo` rather than `history \| grep foo --color` |
| ks | Kubernetes Secrets. Displays secret key values without so much typing. E.g.: `ks 5j ca.crt` to display ca.crt from secret `deployer-token-5jsxf` |
| sysinfos | Invokes various Linux utils to gather system info and just formats the outputs differently. Mostly an exercise in parsing & formatting |
| tre | Displays a directory tree using bash. Just as an interesting shell programming exercise |
| wpslide | Gnome wallpaper slide-show |
